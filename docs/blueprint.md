## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#293B5F) for a sense of sophistication and trust. The dark hue creates a professional and modern atmosphere suitable for a high-end eyewear brand.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F4F8), a very desaturated version of the primary color, provides a neutral backdrop that makes product images and text stand out.
- Accent color: Muted purple (#845978), an analogous color, adds a touch of creativity and uniqueness without overpowering the design.
- Body font: 'PT Sans', sans-serif, for a clean, modern, and easily readable body text. Headline font: 'Playfair', serif, for a high-end, elegant heading feel.
- Modern and minimalist icons for product features and navigation, ensuring clarity and ease of use.
- Maintain a clean and organized layout with ample white space to enhance user experience and focus attention on products.
